### Introduction

Effects of globalization on the world.
- tremendous potential that a globally interconnected network offers
- at the same time it has become clear that this space produces a wide variety of risks, for which no easy solutions exist
- In recent decades a sense of uncertainty has increased among nation states.
- disappearance of borders / capitalist economy has become the global norm / increased cultural flows across the globe
- increasing instability in geopolitics
- more opportunistic and short-lived partnerships between nation states and more rapid [dynamism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dynamism "Learn more about dynamism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the alliances that nations states make with other nation states

Rise of digital network technologies
- these networks form an ecosystem of incredible complexity, called cyberspace
- On the one hand, the rise of digital networked technologies has strengthened globalization
- On the other the global spread of cyberspace can also be considered an effect of globalization.

Combined, globalization, increased geopolitical instability and the rise of digital networked technologies lead to more uncertainty for the international community


### Seeking to reduce uncertainty through gaining more _control_, using risk management

Risk management is the dominant paradigm of dealing with risk in our modern times.
In recent decades, risk management has become a key activity in organizations, which seek to reduce risks internally but also regarding the products or services they deliver to customers.

#### Five steps to managing risk

As a method, risk management consists of a number of different steps.

##### identification of risks 
- gaining an understanding of the sources and substance of risks that may lead to incidents in relation to a particular activity, system

##### individual risks are analyzed or assessed
- involves establishing the likelihood of the materialization of specific risks as well as determining the potential impact they may have once they materialize.
- Risk assessments can be conducted in a qualitative or a quantitative way, but risk management is most well-known for the latter. For its ability to express the size of risks through a formula, such as risk = probability x impact

##### prioritization of risks
- decision-makers prioritize which risks need to be addressed first and to which risk levels they need to be reduced
- Making this call is based on the risk appetite of the entity that is managing the risks
- The purpose is to reduce risks to acceptable risk levels

##### prioritized risks are treated
- actions will be undertaken to reduce the likelihood and/or the impact of their instantiation
- Treatment may take different forms, depending on the type of risk, the context and the entity's risk appetite. Four common forms of treatment are: 

	- accepting risks, i.e. not treating them (further) because the cost-benefit ratio is such that this would be considered a waste of resources
	- aborting activities in which the stakes are too high entirely because the impact of the materialization of a risk would be disastrous
	- transferring the risk to another party that is better equipped to carry the burden
	- mitigating the risk, i.e. seeking to implement preventative or restorative measures so that the likelihood and/or impact of a risk go down.

##### risk monitoring
- all previous steps are evaluated
- Entities verify whether the treatment of risks has been effective and monitor whether new risks are on the horizon
- With this step, the cycle of risk management is closed and loops back into step 1 of risk identification.

#### Criticisms of risk management

Risk management has been especially successful in the field of engineering, where it is used to build and deliver safer products and services.
Because of its success risk management has spread to other societal domains and has become the dominant paradigm for dealing with risk for organizations and governments alike.
However, in recent years several lines of criticism have been launched against the use of risk management outside its original habitat of engineering. These criticisms focus mostly on three issues:
- complexity
- predictability
- modelling

##### complexity

Critics point out that while engineering challenges, such as increasing car or airplane safety, are challenging because cars and airplanes are **complex** machines, the level of complexity of these systems pales in contrast to that of, for instance, waging a war against another state, or making cyberspace more secure.

Cyberspace is considered to be one of these highly complex systems. Because of cyberspace's tremendous complexity, it is far more challenging to establish likelihoods and impacts with respect to risks in this domain. As a consequence, the level of uncertainty in calculations of risk increases to such a degree that it becomes questionable how useful such calculations are.

##### predictability

In [cybersecurity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/cybersecurity "Learn more about cybersecurity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") there is a data problem that is absent. 

Since its inception in the early 20th century, the airline industry worldwide has collaborated to generate a single data set in which all near misses and accidents are reported. This vast data set is used to ensure that the learnings from past incidents can contribute to preventing their reoccurrence. Because so much data is available, calculating the likelihood and impact of incidents is quite precise, which contributes to predictability. 

For cyberspace we do not have a data set like this.
There is also significant underreporting because organizations that are hit by attacks or outages often prefer to keep this information to themselves for fear of reputation damage. And finally: cyberspace does not have a one-hundred-year history yet, so we are still learning what the vulnerabilities in cyberspace are.

##### modelling

Finally, modelling is very difficult in relation to cyberspace.
In aviation, new features in airplanes are tested under a variety of conditions in a modelled environment.
But how does one simulate a part of cyberspace in such a way that it truly mimics real-world conditions? Despite the fact that significant advances have been made in the field of simulation-based accident scenario exploration, it still remains difficult to create simulations that actually do [justice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/justice "Learn more about justice from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to the complexity and connectivity in real-world cyberspace contexts.

##### TLDR

Combined, these three criticisms – cyberspace's complexity, a lack of data, and a lack of possibilities to simulate – lead some critics to argue that the risk management has limited value for cyber-security. At the same time, for public and private organizations it is often the go-to. In recent years several other approaches have gained popularity in response to dealing with risk in cyberspace, alongside risk management.
