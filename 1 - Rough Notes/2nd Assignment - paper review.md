### Introduction

Effects of globalization on the world.
- tremendous potential that a globally interconnected network offers
- at the same time it has become clear that this space produces a wide variety of risks, for which no easy solutions exist
- In recent decades a sense of uncertainty has increased among nation states.
- disappearance of borders / capitalist economy has become the global norm / increased cultural flows across the globe
- increasing instability in geopolitics
- more opportunistic and short-lived partnerships between nation states and more rapid [dynamism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dynamism "Learn more about dynamism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the alliances that nations states make with other nation states

Rise of digital network technologies
- these networks form an ecosystem of incredible complexity, called cyberspace
- On the one hand, the rise of digital networked technologies has strengthened globalization
- On the other the global spread of cyberspace can also be considered an effect of globalization.

Combined, globalization, increased geopolitical instability and the rise of digital networked technologies lead to more uncertainty for the international community


### Seeking to reduce uncertainty through gaining more _control_, using risk management

Risk management is the dominant paradigm of dealing with risk in our modern times.
In recent decades, risk management has become a key activity in organizations, which seek to reduce risks internally but also regarding the products or services they deliver to customers.

#### Five steps to managing risk

As a method, risk management consists of a number of different steps.

**identification of risks** 
- gaining an understanding of the sources and substance of risks that may lead to incidents in relation to a particular activity, system

**individual risks are analyzed or assessed**
- involves establishing the likelihood of the materialization of specific risks as well as determining the potential impact they may have once they materialize.
- Risk assessments can be conducted in a qualitative or a quantitative way, but risk management is most well-known for the latter. For its ability to express the size of risks through a formula, such as risk = probability x impact

**prioritization of risks**
- decision-makers prioritize which risks need to be addressed first and to which risk levels they need to be reduced
- Making this call is based on the risk appetite of the entity that is managing the risks
- The purpose is to reduce risks to acceptable risk levels

**prioritized risks are treated**
- actions will be undertaken to reduce the likelihood and/or the impact of their instantiation
- Treatment may take different forms, depending on the type of risk, the context and the entity's risk appetite. Four common forms of treatment are: 

	- accepting risks, i.e. not treating them (further) because the cost-benefit ratio is such that this would be considered a waste of resources
	- aborting activities in which the stakes are too high entirely because the impact of the materialization of a risk would be disastrous
	- transferring the risk to another party that is better equipped to carry the burden
	- mitigating the risk, i.e. seeking to implement preventative or restorative measures so that the likelihood and/or impact of a risk go down.

**risk monitoring**
- all previous steps are evaluated
- Entities verify whether the treatment of risks has been effective and monitor whether new risks are on the horizon
- With this step, the cycle of risk management is closed and loops back into step 1 of risk identification.

#### Criticisms of risk management



### Increasing the _adaptability_ of systems to withstand incidents through the notion of resilience



### Decreasing uncertainty by _steering_ or _influencing_ the behaviors of actors in cyberspace through regulation



### _Suspending_ uncertainties by using trust



### _Ignoring_ uncertainties by choosing not to act on them
