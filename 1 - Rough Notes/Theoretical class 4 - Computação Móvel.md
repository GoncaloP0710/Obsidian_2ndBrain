# Theoretical class 4 - Computação Móvel
How do the challenges, for example, of context ambiguity, privacy, and user control influence each stage of the design process for context-aware applications, and what strategies can be implemented to address these issues?

(max. 400 words)

Many applications have severel issues related with the way they obtain and use the information related with their context. These problem can be due to incorrect output of sensers, the way data is used and the privacy aspect of it, incorrect input of users, etc.
In order to deal with problems related with the ambiguity of the context diferent stratagys can be used. For instance, multiple sources of context (sensors) can be combined in order to reach a more precise and trustworthy result. Other than that, the developers can also chose to depend on a user feedback in order to eliminate the possible ambigguity of the context.
