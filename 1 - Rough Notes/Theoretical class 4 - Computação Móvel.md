How do the challenges, for example, of context ambiguity, privacy, and user control influence each stage of the design process for context-aware applications, and what strategies can be implemented to address these issues?

(max. 400 words)

Many applications have several issues associated with the way they obtain and use the information related with their context. This problem can be due to incorrect output of sensors, the way data is used (the privacy aspect of it), incorrect input of users, etc.
In order to deal with problems related with the ambiguity of the context, different strategies can be used. For instance, multiple sources of context (sensors) can be combined in order to reach a more precise and trustworthy result. Other than that, the developers can also choose to depend on a user feedback in order to eliminate the possible ambiguity of the context. Due to this problem, the app designers must consider different ways to deal with context ambiguity that can increase the complexity of it.
Nowadays, privacy is a very important topic that is also a factor when building a mobile application. Usually, these type of apps often gather a large amount of data which must be shared only among components that need it, with the objective of preserving the privacy of the users. In order to handle these data transactions accordingly, there is a need to implement proper defense and mitigation mechanisms. It is a must that the user’s privacy is maintained and for that to happen the app developers must design their system with the ability to preserve it.
