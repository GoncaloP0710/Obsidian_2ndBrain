# Motivation to Software Security

## Are there many vulnerabilities?

Industry average is about 15 to 50 errors per 1000 LoC.
But on the bright side, **not all errors are vulnerabilities**.

## Are there many different vulnerabilities?

There are several classification efforts, namely a community effort called Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). Research concepts view has more than 900 classes.

## How good are we at finding vulnerabilities?

It is **undecidable** to find all possible run-time errors in an arbitrary program.
**Approximate solutions** can help but they takea **long time** to process large programs.
But **vulnerability discovery** approaches are continuously **evolving** and are becoming **more effective**. 

## Bountie Hunters

Offering a **bug bounty** is one of the best ways for software companies to **find problems** with their applications and services before they can be exploited.

Offering a reward means those who find a flaw may opt to cash in, instead of selling it to those who would use it for nefarious purposes.

## What about fixing vulnerabilities?

Flaws with high severity (i.e., pose a more serious risk) appear to be prioritized over others (the lesser severe flaws).

### WHO IS TO BLAME?

#### Industry’s fault?
