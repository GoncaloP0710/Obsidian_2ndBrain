# 2nd Assignment paper review

### Gonçalo Pinto – Fc58178

## Objective and Purpose

The paper from Bibi van den Berg (2024), focuses on the topic of the uncertainties in cyberspace by giving valid insight on different ways of responding to different uncertainties in cyberspace.

Firstly, the author starts by introducing the idea that the globalization took a major role on the global spread of cyberspace and that the rise of digital networked technologies has strengthened globalization. Combined, globalization, increased geopolitical instability and the rise of digital networked technologies lead to more uncertainty for the international community.

Secondly, different strategies to address the uncertainty are mentioned and explored. Between all possible ways of dealing with the problem at hand, the writer focusses on these next ones: risk management, resilience, regulation, trust and doing nothing. Bibi van den Berg does a in depth analysis on each strategy giving real life examples of their use.

Finaly, the author ends by talking about how impactful and useful each of the individual responses to uncertainty mentioned are and how some can be mixed to best address some vulnerabilities, threats and risks.

The paper represents a theoretical framework offering insights into how different entities cope with the risks and synthesizes existing strategies to propose a structured way to understand and manage uncertainty in digital contexts. The problem it seeks to solve is how should uncertainty in cyberspace be dealt with.

## Contribution and relevance

The writers work adds value to its readers by explaining the topic of uncertainty in digital contexts and exposing very well thought ideas on the ways this problem can be managed.

The author does not provide new perspectives but tackles the challenge of dealing with the uncertainty of the cyberspace. All the different perspectives on how to address uncertainty already existed and were simply summarized and well explained in the article.

The paper does not completely solve the problem at hand but provides a structured framework that indicates potential strategies to address the uncertainty. Its ideas are of an extreme relevance not only because they are used in real life as the writer shows, but also duo to their extreme effectiveness on some cases.

## Quality of Research and Methodology

The research the author did was very rigorous which can be seen by all the references to other scientific papers, as well as all the real-life examples mentioned on the article.

The methods of research used by the writer are appropriate and well-executed since all the investigation was documented in the paper with links to definitions and other articles therefore providing robust evidence to support its claims.

From what I could tell, there were no limitations or gaps in the research design that could weaken the paper’s conclusions which goes to show the professionalism of the Prof.dr. Bibi van den Berg.

## Key Takeaways and Insights

The paper key takeaways were most of them related to the different strategies to address the uncertainty and how they should be used.

Risk management is the dominant paradigm of dealing with risk in our modern times. As a method, risk management consists of several different steps: identification of risks, individual risks are analyzed or assessed, prioritization of risks, prioritized risks are treated and finally risk monitoring.

Resilience has become a prominently used approach in relation to uncertainties in cyberspace. Three main interpretations of resilience can be distinguished: resilience as a form of protection, resilience as preparedness and resilience as the ability to adapt.

Regulation has a way of steering behavior in certain directions. This is also a way of taming uncertainty because the predictability of actors may be increased in specific contexts. Three different kinds of regulation can be distinguished: inside-in regulation, inside-out regulation and outside-out regulation.

Suspending uncertainties by using trust. Complexity is reduced through trust; it enables us to act against a backdrop of high ambiguity and variability.

Ignoring uncertainties by choosing not to act on them. Currently this strategy is not practiced very often in the field of cyber-security. Researchers and practitioners in the field sometimes express concern over the lack of response to encountered risks in cyberspace.

The author changed my perspective on risk management. Despite being very powerful, sometimes it might not be the best approach. Before reading the article, I was convinced that this approach could be used in any scenario and perform the best. Other than that, I was also certain that only one strategy could be used at once but after reading the paper I understood that we can mix them to create a better solution.

## Technical Aspects

## Strengths and Weaknesses

In my opinion, the strongest point of the paper was all the research done behind to support the writer’s point of view since it left a strong impression.

In terms of weaknesses, limitations, or areas that could be improved, I found nothing to point at.
