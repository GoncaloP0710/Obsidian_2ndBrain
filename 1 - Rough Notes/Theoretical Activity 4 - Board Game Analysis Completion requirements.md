# Theoretical Activity 4 - Board Game Analysis Completion requirements

**Board Game Analysis**

Choose a game you never played before and donâ€™t know the rules. Learn the rules by reading the rulebook or through video instructions before playing We recommend one of the listed above for their simplicity, relatively short play time and rulebook (but you are free to choose others more complex). Do not pick traditional games of chess, hearts and so on. If you have any doubts if the game is eligible ask.

Play it with a group of friends (or with your work group). Describe your learning process. Collect, analyse and report the group's impressions regarding the learning experience/rule set.

## Cascadia

### Describe your learning process

I started by reading the rules PDF file of the game "Cascadia" as instructed by the professor in the theoretical class. It was a little bit confusing at first due to the many mechanics and items introduced by the rules. On the one hand, the setup of the game was very simple to understand thanks to the many images exemplifying the different pieces. On the other hand, the gameplay loop and the end game scoring part of the rule set was way harder and complicated to fully grasp. In particular, the usage of the "Nature Token" was difficult to comprehend because of all the different ways it can be used and effects it can trigger. Once we started playing, all the concepts introduced by the rules became clear, including the "Nature Token" mechanics that were not fully grasped until then. At the end, the only problem I faced was the counting of the points that took a bit more of reading to get it into my head.
