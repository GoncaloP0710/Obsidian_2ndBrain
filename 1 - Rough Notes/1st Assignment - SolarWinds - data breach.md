# SolarWinds - data breach

More than 18,000 customers of SolarWinds had applied the Sunburst update, which then **allowed the remote access trojan to infect all their customer systems and networks**.

## Timeline of the breach

- The attackers accessed the build system belonging to the software company SolarWinds.
- In the build system, the attackers modified software updates provided by SolarWinds to users of its network monitoring software Orion (a cloud platform for molecular design and simulation needs, eliminating the need to buy and maintain expensive infrastructure.). First known modification, in October 2019
- The attackers spent from December 2019 to February 2020 setting up a Botnet infrastructure.
- In March 2020, the attackers began to plant remote access tool malware into Orion updates. These users included U.S. government customers in the executive branch, the military, and the intelligence services.
- The attackers appear to have utilized only a small fraction of the successful malware deployments: ones located within computer networks belonging to high-value targets.
