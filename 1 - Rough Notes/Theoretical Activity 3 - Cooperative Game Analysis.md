# Theoretical Activity 3 - Cooperative Game Analysis - Brawl Stars

## Group Formation

- Party Creation - players can create a friends list within the game and invite their friends to join their party for multi-player matches. There is also the option to invite players to the party with only their IDs. https://external-preview.redd.it/cant-invite-a-friend-v0-dDBtbjZuZ2R4eDFiMa1lj4-B5Ok5GkZihwWjoKWg_Pzv3j6H-dOIlkRxzwv5.png?format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91fa7eaf69c7e4d3806509053ad346a00fa6c79f
- Drop-in/Drop-out?

## Goal Structure

- Shared - On all the game modes, there is the objective of winning the game that multiple players pursue and work together to achieve. Example: On the game mode "Showdown" at least one player has to be the last to survive in order to win the game. https://preview.redd.it/0g7g0e81aq611.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3d60e825570c29fcf0367fbb9513f8d0d4c1f209
- Conflicting? Star player?

## Progression structure

- Individual - players gain resources and trophies. After each play session the individual accumulated resources can be spent however a player wants to progress their overall account level. This progression bears no impact on the other playersâ€™ experience other than a stronger teammate if they play together again. https://interfaceingame.com/wp-content/uploads/brawl-stars/brawl-stars-resources.png

## Player Identity

- Single - players have control of one single entity. https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOY_v31JeFQ/maxresdefault.jpg
- Distinct?

## Selection

- Pool - players are given an array of playable entities to choose from (Brawlers). These have predefined game-play characteristics and players are forced to have a unique selection of Brawlers. https://i.redd.it/39yjg447qmva1.jpg
