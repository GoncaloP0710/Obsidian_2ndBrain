# Functional Encryption

FE is a generalization of Public-Key Cryptography.

A master secret key allows a data owner to build different secret keys.

Each secret key allows evaluating a pre-defined function on a message m and learn nothing else about m.

## Sub-Classes of FE

- Predicate Encryption w/ Public Index
- Predicate Encryption (w/ private index) - In this case, the index (e.g., the identity) is hidden / secret.
