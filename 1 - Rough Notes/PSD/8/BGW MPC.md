# BGW MPC

The BGW protocol explores Shamir’s SS, instead of 𝑡 = 𝑛 SS

BGW can be used for both Boolean and arithmetic circuits.

Performance
- O(1) communication cost for addition gates
- O(N2) communication cost for multiplication gates
- Nº of communication rounds linear w/ circuit depth

Security
- The protocol provides perfect security against passive adversaries.
