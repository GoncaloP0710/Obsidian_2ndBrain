# Theoretical Activity 3 - Cooperative Game Analysis - Brawl Stars

## Group Formation

- Party Creation - players can create a friends list within the game and invite their friends to join their party for multi-player matches. There is also the option to invite players to the party with only their IDs. https://external-preview.redd.it/cant-invite-a-friend-v0-dDBtbjZuZ2R4eDFiMa1lj4-B5Ok5GkZihwWjoKWg_Pzv3j6H-dOIlkRxzwv5.png?format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91fa7eaf69c7e4d3806509053ad346a00fa6c79f
- Drop-in/Drop-out?
- Looking for Group - players can look for a party in the menu by searching group queues. There is also the matchmaking option where players are matched with others of the same skill. https://preview.redd.it/is-this-only-happening-to-me-v0-8d1xct17y6wb1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=11de2a2d6105b71e020a036363090f97f42eddb3

## Goal Structure

- Shared - On all the game modes, there is the objective of winning the game that multiple players pursue and work together to achieve. Example: On the game mode "Showdown" at least one player has to be the last to survive in order to win the game. https://preview.redd.it/0g7g0e81aq611.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3d60e825570c29fcf0367fbb9513f8d0d4c1f209
- Conflicting? Star player?

## Progression structure

- Individual - players gain resources and trophies. After each play session the individual accumulated resources can be spent however a player wants to progress their overall account level. This progression bears no impact on the other players’ experience other than a stronger teammate if they play together again. https://interfaceingame.com/wp-content/uploads/brawl-stars/brawl-stars-resources.png

## Player Identity

- Single - players have control of one single entity. https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOY_v31JeFQ/maxresdefault.jpg
- Distinct?

## Selection

- Pool - players are given an array of playable entities to choose from (Brawlers). These have predefined game-play characteristics and players are forced to have a unique selection of Brawlers. https://i.redd.it/39yjg447qmva1.jpg

## Progress

- Customizable - players can upgrade their brawlers, unlock new mechanics/abilities and buy skins in order to change the representation of the character. https://interfaceingame.com/wp-content/uploads/brawl-stars/brawl-stars-select-brawler.png
- Switchable?

## Relationships between Player Entities

- Teammates - players within a team need to coordinate their actions, abilities, and roles in order to win the game. 
- Competitors - players compete with other players.

## Game World

- Unique - players have access to the same world but due to the different abilities one has, multiple perspectives are achieved. 

## Player Viewpoint

- Distinct - each player has control of their viewpoint through separate screens. Players do not share their screens or perspectives.

## Arrangement

- Coincident cooperation - players are accomplishing the same task together, in this case: defeating the enemy team.

## Synchronicity 

- Concurrent cooperation - players have to perform game-play tasks concurrently. Players are playing simultaneously and are expected to coordinate actions for success.

## Communication Expected by Design

- Limited - game restricts communication, allowing communication through only specific modalities like emotes. https://interfaceingame.com/wp-content/uploads/brawl-stars/brawl-stars-emotes.png

## Means of Communication

- Text chat - In the menu of the game, players can communicate with each other using a text chat.
- Premade Messages - 
- Emotes - At the middle of a game, players can communicate with each other using emotes.

## Dependencies

- Task - In the heist game mode, players are tasked with destroying the other teams safe in order to win the game. That forces players to coordinate to be effective and complete it.
- Grouping? Does matchmaking remove grouping?
- Spatial? Showdown with the zone?

## Affecting others

- Assistive Actions - There are brawlers whose main objective is healing/support others.
- Piggy-Backing? If in duo showdowns one player carries is it consider Piggy-Backing?

## Resource Sharing

- Consumables - There are various items in different game modes that increase the power level of your brawler. https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IoyG5zFqyeg/sddefault.jpg
- Unlockables - Most of the game modes are locked behind a certain amount of trophies but if one of the players in the party has access to the game mode, all the party will have as well. 
- Space - In the game there are several mechanics that are related to the space and position of the players. For instance, there exists a turret that heals allies on a certain range. https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/JoCXLWcpDm11MKQ_3YEhTs5D-cIAuyB5bQLDfqyayo0fyrKeygfJA5SFZIu9Gu2eeV1_lnYWoZrwdEx-SolLw-65l6hWdXJqUqprcefI2vN_WmlUHfZNUJMRc1IzGrSzGWSRP2AZ6qT99LV_q5sM5fdS-Q1JOHZ9pbOW2L5tqH2vSZMh

## Asymmetry

- Abilities - In brawl stars all player's controller different abilities and must collaborate to synergise and complement each other.

## Relations between Player Actions

- Complementarity - Player actions are designed to balance each other’s weaknesses. Its is shown by the defined meta of using a tank, support and dps character on the same team.

# Difficulties with the analysis process and understanding LFCG

While going through all the options on the LFCG framework I found myself sometimes having difficulties choosing which options were best fitted for the game I chose. But thanks to the good definitions on the paper provided by the professor, after a quick read it soon became clear what options related best with the game.

# Reflection of your analysis

With my analysis I now have a bigger knowledge on all the complex subjects behind cooperative games, in specific Brawl Stars. There are a lot of different sub-genres of cooperative games that I didn't know before making my report on Brawl Stars. 

# Reflection of the potential uses of LFCG

The LFCG framework was really clear and complete when making my report on the game. I believe it can become a very good tool for game analysis related with cooperative games. Other than that, I don't see any scenario where it can be used.
