# Protection of Resources

- A computer contains **several resources**, often called **objects**.
- **Objects** are **accessed by subjects**

Role of the OS: **ensure that objects** are only **accessed** by **authorized subjects**.

There are two main mechanisms to ensure that objects are not accessed by unauthorized subjects.
- **Separation** – prevent arbitrary access to objects
- **Mediation** – control the access to the object
