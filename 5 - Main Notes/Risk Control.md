# Risk Control

### Risk Control Strategies
Once created a ranked risk register, we must choose one of the basic control strategies:
- **Modification** (27005) = Defense (Whitman) + Mitigation (Whitman)
- **Sharing** (27005) = Transferal (Whitman)
- **Retention** (27005) = Acceptance (Whitman)
- **Avoidance** (27005) = Termination (Whitman)

## Modification (27005)
### Modification (27005) Defense
Defense risk control strategy - attempts to prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability.
- Accomplished by means of countering threats, removing vulnerabilities in assets, ...
Three common methods of risk defense:
- Application of policy
- Application of training and education
- Implementation of technology

### Modification (27005) Mitigation
Mitigation is a control that we apply after the incident occurs.
It attempts to reduce the damage caused by a realized incident or disaster.
Includes three types of plans:
- Incident response (IR) plan
- Disaster recovery (DR) plan
- Business continuity (BC) plan

## Sharing (27005) Transferal
Transferal risk control strategy - attempts to shift the risk to other assets, other processes, or other organizations.

## Retention (27005) Acceptance
Acceptance risk control strategy - the decision to do nothing to protect an information asset from risk and accept the outcome.

## Termination (Whitman) Avoidance
Termination risk control strategy - based on the organizationâ€™s need or choice not to protect an asset.
- The organization does not wish the asset to remain at risk so it is removed from the environment that represents risk
