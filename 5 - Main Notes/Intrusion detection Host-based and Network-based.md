# Intrusion detection Host-based and Network-based

## Host-based

- e-box is a host
- Collected info: session duration, commands, files accessed, etc.
- Data collection should not be performance intrusive

## Network-based

Network IDS work somewhat like a network Anti-virus. (Also called IPS - Intrusion Prevention System)
- e-box is “the network
- Collected info: packet headers, full packets, etc.
- Data collection can be easily done with a promiscuous network interface
