# Attacks

Malicious action that attempts to exploit one or more vulnerabilities.

(Attack + Vulnerability) â‡¾ Intrusion

Exploit - an attack directed to a certain vulnerability.

Patch - a software that fixes a defect and therefore should remove the vulnerability.

### Attack surface
The attack surface of a software environment is the sum of the different points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data.

Reducing the attack surface is a basic security measure.
