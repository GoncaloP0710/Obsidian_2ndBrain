# Motivation to Software Security

## Are there many vulnerabilities?

Industry average is about 15 to 50 errors per 1000 LoC.
But on the bright side, **not all errors are vulnerabilities**.

## Are there many different vulnerabilities?

There are several classification efforts, namely a community effort called Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). Research concepts view has more than 900 classes.

## How good are we at finding vulnerabilities?

It is **undecidable** to find all possible run-time errors in an arbitrary program.
**Approximate solutions** can help but they takea **long time** to process large programs.
But **vulnerability discovery** approaches are continuously **evolving** and are becoming **more effective**. 

## Bountie Hunters

Offering a **bug bounty** is one of the best ways for software companies to **find problems** with their applications and services before they can be exploited.

Offering a reward means those who find a flaw may opt to cash in, instead of selling it to those who would use it for nefarious purposes.

## What about fixing vulnerabilities?

Flaws with high severity (i.e., pose a more serious risk) appear to be prioritized over others (the lesser severe flaws).

### WHO IS TO BLAME?

- Industryâ€™s fault?

**Software buyers** are literally **crash test dummies** for an industry that is remarkably insulated against liability, accountability, and responsibility for any harm, damages or loss that should occur because of manufacturing defects or weaknesses that allow cyber attackers to break into and hijack our computer systems.

## Trinity of trouble

- Complexity
- Extensibility
- Connectivity

- Other problems: time to market

### Future of SW

- More components
- More frameworks, more combination of binary and executed code
- More tablets / smartphones, embedded systems (IoT)
- More wireless
- **More complexity, extensibility, connectivity**

**While AI allows more code to written more quickly, it does not deliver more secure code!!!**
