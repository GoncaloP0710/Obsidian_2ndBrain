# Stack Overflows

A **Stack Overflow** occurs when a program writes more data to the stack than it is allocated, causing it to overwrite adjacent memory. The **stack** is a special region of a process's memory that stores **function calls**, **local variables**, and **return addresses**.

A stack overflow can cause **program crashes** or open the door to **security vulnerabilities**, allowing attackers to manipulate the program's execution flow, often leading to **remote code execution (RCE)**.
