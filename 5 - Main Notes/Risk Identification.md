# Risk Identification

The first operational phase of the RM process is the identification of risk, which begins with the process of self-examination.

At this stage, managers must:
- identify the organizationâ€™s information assets
- classify them
- categorize them into useful groups
- prioritize them by overall importance

The risk identification process begins with the identification and cataloging of information assets, including people, procedures, data, software, hardware, and networking elements.

#### Identifying Hardware, Software, and Network Assets
Asset inventory systems - keep track of hardware, network, and perhaps software components.
Organizations that do not use an automated inventory system must create a
manual process.
The inventory process requires a lot of planning. Must determine which attributes of each information asset should be tracked.

#### Identifying People, Procedures, and Data Assets
The record-keeping system should be flexible, allowing you to link assets to attributes.

### Classifying and Categorizing Assets
Determine whether asset categories are meaningful to the organization.
A classification scheme should be developed that categorizes information assets based on their sensitivity and security needs.
Classification categories must be comprehensive and mutually exclusive.
