# Risk Identification

The first operational phase of the RM process is the identification of risk, which begins with the process of self-examination.

At this stage, managers must:
- identify the organizationâ€™s information assets
- classify them
- categorize them into useful groups
- prioritize them by overall importance

The risk identification process begins with the identification and cataloging of information assets, including people, procedures, data, software, hardware, and networking elements.

#### Identifying Hardware, Software, and Network Assets
Asset inventory systems - keep track of hardware, network, and perhaps software components.
Organizations that do not use an automated inventory system must create a manual process.
The inventory process requires a lot of planning. Must determine which attributes of each information asset should be tracked.

#### Identifying People, Procedures, and Data Assets
The record-keeping system should be flexible, allowing you to link assets to attributes.

### Classifying and Categorizing Assets
Determine whether asset categories are meaningful to the organization.
A classification scheme should be developed that categorizes information assets based on their sensitivity and security needs.
Classification categories must be comprehensive and mutually exclusive.

As each information asset is identified, categorized, and classified
- A relative value must be assigned to it
Relative values are comparative judgments intended to ensure the most valuable information assets are given the highest priority.

## Threat Identification
Process of assessing potential exploitation of weaknesses in each information asset.

Threat assessment - Each identified threat must be further examined to determine its potential to affect the targeted information asset.

Prioritizing Threats - Just as it did with information assets, the organization should conduct a weighted table analysis with threats. The organization should list the categories of threats it faces, and then select categories that correspond to the questions of interest.

### Vulnerability Assessment
Review of each asset to identify threats and vulnerabilities
Assess vulnerabilities using specific metrics like CVSS

## TVA Worksheet
At the end of the risk identification process, an organization should have
- a prioritized list of assets
- a prioritized list of threats facing those assets
The prioritized lists of assets and threats can be combined into a Threats-Vulnerabilities-Assets (TVA) worksheet, in preparation for the addition of vulnerability and control information during risk assessment.
This provides a starting point for a risk assessment.

Vulnerabilities are identified between threats and assets and are categorized as follows:
- T1V1A1 - Vulnerability 1 that exists between Threat 1 and Asset 1
- T1V2A1 - Vulnerability 2 that exists between Threat 1 and Asset 1
- ...
