# Property-Preserving Encryption

The goal of Property-Preserving Encryption is to allow some **properties** of the **plaintext** to be **preserved** after **encryption**.

There are 2 major forms of property-preserving encryption:
- Deterministic Encryption (DET)
- Order-Preserving Encryption (OPE)
