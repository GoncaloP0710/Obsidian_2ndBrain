# Security Logging and Monitoring

Main idea: there is insufficient capability in the system monitor activities and deficient integration with incident response, allowing attacks to remain undiscovered and extended to other parts of the site.
- lack of monitoring, logging or alerting can lead to a far worse outcome than the initial breach

### Protection
- log all relevant error conditions
- high value operations need to have an audit trail that cannot be erased
- adopt an incident response and recovery plan
