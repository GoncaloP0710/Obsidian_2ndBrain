# Present Value vs. Future value

I’m investing 100K€ in an amazing deal – I’m sure next year I’ll earn 3.5K€
the guaranteed interest rate in the bank is 4% (after taxes)
The future value of my money if I keep it in the bank
- 100 x (1 + 0.04) = 104

Future value: the value of a sum after investing it over one or more periods

Present value: the amount of money that should be put in the alternative investment (the bank) in order to obtain the expected amount in the next period (or a future period).

The present value for my business would be PV
- PV x (1 + 0.04) = €103.5
- PV = €103.5 /1.04
- PV = €99.519
- Present value of investment < my actual cash flow ⇾ Don’t invest!

## Net Present Value Model

Net present value: the PV of all cash flows = PV of future cash flows minus PV of the cost of the investment.
