# Raiding

Raiding is the copying of data from an internal server (e.g., website, database) to an external unknown/suspicious server.
- Data theft is still the most basic attack against internal servers

The difference between raiding and legitimate access is a matter of degree, as the point of any server is to serve data.

How to identify raiding?
- Analyze flow data volume
- Raiding is usually done quickly

Steps:
- Build a model of the normal traffic volume
- Calibrate the model
- Find if the suspect traffic is normal or not
