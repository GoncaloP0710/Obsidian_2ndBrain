# Paging

The memory of a process is divided in pages of the same size.
- physical memory is divided into page frames of the same size as a page â€¦ so, there is no fragmentation, and knowing the end is trivial
- memory is addressed by (page, offset)

From a protection point of view, pages are like segments
- a process sees a physical page only if the page appears in its **page translation table**
- information about access rights (ex: WRITE, EXECUTE) is stored in the table, and access rights are enforced per access
