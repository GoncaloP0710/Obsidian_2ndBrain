# Vulnerability scanners

Classical search for vulnerabilities in computer systems
- experiment various tests that "exploit" certain already known vulnerabilities
- often, they provide hints on how to fix the discovered flaws

Web vulnerability scanners – for web applications (more recent)

### Web vuln.scanners – NIST
NIST specified a set of basic requirements
- Identify all the types of vulnerabilities in their list
- Report an attack that demonstrates the vulnerability
- ...

#### Web vuln.scanners vs fuzzers
- Separation is not entirely clear
- Web vulnerability scanners also “inject attacks”, like fuzzers
- Web vulnerability scanners run database of specific attacks, while the others are (more) random
