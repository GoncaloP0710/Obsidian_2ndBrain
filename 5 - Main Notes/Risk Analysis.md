# Risk Analysis

### Quantitative approach
Risk analysis is a process that assigns a comparative risk rating or score to each information vulnerability/asset.
A repeatable method to evaluate the relative risk of each vulnerability/asset.

General Expression: Risk is The **likelihood of the occurrence** of a vulnerability $*$ the **value of the asset**.

#### Assessing Potential Impact on Asset Value
Once the probability of an attack by a threat has been evaluated, the organization will typically look at the possible impact or consequences of a successful attack.
The impact of an attack (most often as a loss in asset value) is of great concern to the organization in determining where to focus its protection efforts.
It is useful for organizations to retain this information, as it can also be used during contingency planning.

### Percentage of Risk Mitigated by Current Controls
- If a vulnerability is **fully managed** by an existing control - It can be set aside
- If a vulnerability is **partially controlled** - Estimate what percentage of the vulnerability has been controlled
- **Uncertainty** - A factor that accounts for uncertainty must always be added to the equations

### Identify Possible Controls
For each threat and its associated vulnerabilities that have residual risk
- The organization should create a preliminary list of controls
- Purpose of the list is to identify areas of residual risk

**Residual risk: risk that remains even after the existing controls have been applied**

### Results of Risk Analysis
A ranked vulnerability risk worksheet should be produced.
