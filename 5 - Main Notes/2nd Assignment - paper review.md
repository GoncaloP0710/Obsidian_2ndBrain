### Introduction

Effects of globalization on the world.
- tremendous potential that a globally interconnected network offers
- at the same time it has become clear that this space produces a wide variety of risks, for which no easy solutions exist
- In recent decades a sense of uncertainty has increased among nation states.
- disappearance of borders / capitalist economy has become the global norm / increased cultural flows across the globe
- increasing instability in geopolitics
- more opportunistic and short-lived partnerships between nation states and more rapid [dynamism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dynamism "Learn more about dynamism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the alliances that nations states make with other nation states

Rise of digital network technologies
- these networks form an ecosystem of incredible complexity, called cyberspace
- On the one hand, the rise of digital networked technologies has strengthened globalization
- On the other the global spread of cyberspace can also be considered an effect of globalization.

Combined, globalization, increased geopolitical instability and the rise of digital networked technologies lead to more uncertainty for the international community


### Seeking to reduce uncertainty through gaining more _control_, using risk management

Risk management is the dominant paradigm of dealing with risk in our modern times.
In recent decades, risk management has become a key activity in organizations, which seek to reduce risks internally but also regarding the products or services they deliver to customers.

#### Five steps to managing risk

As a method, risk management consists of a number of different steps.

##### identification of risks 
- gaining an understanding of the sources and substance of risks that may lead to incidents in relation to a particular activity, system

##### individual risks are analyzed or assessed
- involves establishing the likelihood of the materialization of specific risks as well as determining the potential impact they may have once they materialize.
- Risk assessments can be conducted in a qualitative or a quantitative way, but risk management is most well-known for the latter. For its ability to express the size of risks through a formula, such as risk = probability x impact

##### prioritization of risks
- decision-makers prioritize which risks need to be addressed first and to which risk levels they need to be reduced
- Making this call is based on the risk appetite of the entity that is managing the risks
- The purpose is to reduce risks to acceptable risk levels

##### prioritized risks are treated
- actions will be undertaken to reduce the likelihood and/or the impact of their instantiation
- Treatment may take different forms, depending on the type of risk, the context and the entity's risk appetite. Four common forms of treatment are: 

	- accepting risks, i.e. not treating them (further) because the cost-benefit ratio is such that this would be considered a waste of resources
	- aborting activities in which the stakes are too high entirely because the impact of the materialization of a risk would be disastrous
	- transferring the risk to another party that is better equipped to carry the burden
	- mitigating the risk, i.e. seeking to implement preventative or restorative measures so that the likelihood and/or impact of a risk go down.

##### risk monitoring
- all previous steps are evaluated
- Entities verify whether the treatment of risks has been effective and monitor whether new risks are on the horizon
- With this step, the cycle of risk management is closed and loops back into step 1 of risk identification.

#### Criticisms of risk management

Risk management has been especially successful in the field of engineering, where it is used to build and deliver safer products and services.
Because of its success risk management has spread to other societal domains and has become the dominant paradigm for dealing with risk for organizations and governments alike.
However, in recent years several lines of criticism have been launched against the use of risk management outside its original habitat of engineering. These criticisms focus mostly on three issues:
- complexity
- predictability
- modelling

##### complexity

Critics point out that while engineering challenges, such as increasing car or airplane safety, are challenging because cars and airplanes are **complex** machines, the level of complexity of these systems pales in contrast to that of, for instance, waging a war against another state, or making cyberspace more secure.

Cyberspace is considered to be one of these highly complex systems. Because of cyberspace's tremendous complexity, it is far more challenging to establish likelihoods and impacts with respect to risks in this domain. As a consequence, the level of uncertainty in calculations of risk increases to such a degree that it becomes questionable how useful such calculations are.

##### predictability

In [cybersecurity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/cybersecurity "Learn more about cybersecurity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") there is a data problem that is absent. 

Since its inception in the early 20th century, the airline industry worldwide has collaborated to generate a single data set in which all near misses and accidents are reported. This vast data set is used to ensure that the learnings from past incidents can contribute to preventing their reoccurrence. Because so much data is available, calculating the likelihood and impact of incidents is quite precise, which contributes to predictability. 

For cyberspace we do not have a data set like this.
There is also significant underreporting because organizations that are hit by attacks or outages often prefer to keep this information to themselves for fear of reputation damage. And finally: cyberspace does not have a one-hundred-year history yet, so we are still learning what the vulnerabilities in cyberspace are.

##### modelling

Finally, modelling is very difficult in relation to cyberspace.
In aviation, new features in airplanes are tested under a variety of conditions in a modelled environment.
But how does one simulate a part of cyberspace in such a way that it truly mimics real-world conditions? Despite the fact that significant advances have been made in the field of simulation-based accident scenario exploration, it still remains difficult to create simulations that actually do [justice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/justice "Learn more about justice from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to the complexity and connectivity in real-world cyberspace contexts.

##### TLDR

Combined, these three criticisms – cyberspace's complexity, a lack of data, and a lack of possibilities to simulate – lead some critics to argue that the risk management has limited value for cyber-security. At the same time, for public and private organizations it is often the go-to. In recent years several other approaches have gained popularity in response to dealing with risk in cyberspace, alongside risk management.

### Increasing the _adaptability_ of systems to withstand incidents through the notion of resilience

It has become a prominently used approach in relation to uncertainties in cyberspace. The notion of resilience does not have a clear definition. Different views on what resilience is or how it could be accomplished have emerged. Three main interpretations of resilience can be distinguished:
- resilience as a form of protection
- resilience as preparedness
- resilience as the ability to adapt

#### Resilience is about protection

Metaphorically, one could argue that proponents of this view see resilience protecting a treasure vault. Charting the ways in which robbers could break into this vault enables organizations to take measures to prevent a breach of the vault. The more preventative steps one undertakes to protect the vault, the better it will be protected, and the more resilient it is.

This approach is similar to that of risk management. In this interpretation, resilience is the goal of a risk management process. It is the result that flows from the implementation of a proper and well-executed risk management framework.

#### Resilience is about preparedness

This perspective overlaps partially with protection and prevention in the sense that here, too, the aim is to safeguard systems through increased defense.

It differs from the first perspective in that it assumes that incidents will materialize, despite our best efforts to prevent them from occurring. Consequently, we should prepare for the moments when incidents materialize. This entails that in dealing with uncertainty in cyberspace two main organizational strategies should be followed:
- increasing the robustness of systems to withstand a maximum amount of stress and shocks
- ensuring that a wide variety of capabilities are in place so that, should systems fail or services become disrupted in or through an incident, the organization can recuperate or rebound as quickly as possible.

Preparing for incidents is geared towards restoring organizations to normal operations after incidents as swiftly and efficiently as possible.

Preparedness may also involve technical measures, such as building partial redundancies and diversity into systems so that when one sub-system fails another one may take over, or systems may fail gracefully. This increases robustness. 
Adding extra layers of protection around systems is another possible approach.

#### Resilience is about adaptability

The third and final interpretation of the notion of resilience builds on the assumption that systems must be able to withstand sudden and substantial shocks that challenge their functioning and be able to overcome them by being able to adapt to shifting circumstances. Systems are sometimes exposed to grave incidents that cannot be prevented or avoided. Such changes may lead to productive change: systems that can adapt to changed circumstances may thrive and become stronger.

Incidents may be a productive part of cyberspace: they may teach us about vulnerabilities and about ways in which to overcome them. Strong cyber-security means that an organization can withstand a great variety of different kinds of incidents, _and_ when crippling incidents do materialize, that the organization is able to transform itself in their aftermath and to keep on functioning even if going back to the previous state is no longer possible.

Incident response is a crucial part of resilience in the form of adaptability. It refers to the reactions of organizations or individuals to cyber-security incidents. Incident response usually consists of activities such as:
- detecting and analyzing the incident and its causes, including digital forensics
- containing the incident and eradicating its causes
- restoring systems and recovering data or information
- implementing measures to prevent a future reoccurrence of the same type of incident

### Decreasing uncertainty by _steering_ or _influencing_ the behaviors of actors in cyberspace through regulation

While risk management seeks to control uncertainty in cyberspace and resilience aims to improve the ways in which systems can recover from incidents, a third response to dealing with uncertainty in cyberspace is to **regulate the behaviors of actors that make use of this space or contribute to its production**.

The essence of regulation is steering behavior in certain directions. This is also a way of **taming uncertainty because the predictability of actors may be increased in specific contexts**.

Regulation in relation to cyberspace takes various forms. In some cases, actors’ behaviors are regulated through the architecture of the network. In other cases, social norms emerge between different stakeholders in cyberspace. And finally, legal frameworks can regulate behavior in cyberspace.

Three different kinds of regulation can be distinguished: 
- inside-in regulation
- inside-out regulation 
- outside-out regulation

#### Inside-in regulation

The term ‘inside-in regulation’ refers to the idea that nation states or regions seek to influence the behavior of specific actors within their own territory. In practice, what this often entails is that nation states seek to erect borders in cyberspace to control particular types of behavior.

The main reason why nation states _can_ regulate parties, even in relation to a trans-boundary domain such as cyberspace, is because telecommunications companies, banks, etc are by necessity local assets.

#### Inside-out regulation

While inside-in regulation is aimed at influencing the behaviors of actors within the borders of a given nation state. Inside-out regulation is regulation that aims to steer behavior within a state or region that has an (accidental, global) effect on actors outside that state or region.

One of the most well-known examples of inside-out regulation is the so-called ‘Brussels effect’. In the past decades the stringent regulatory standards that the European Union sets to protect EU citizens and to harmonize the EU internal market became regulatory standards worldwide.

The global standard for data protection has increased, because companies such as Facebook and Google must now comply with this standard within the EU and choose to do so outside the EU as well.

#### Outside-out regulation

Nation states or global companies sometimes also seek to regulate the behavior of (other) nation states.

In the last decade and a half, nation states have engaged in international talks on norms for state behavior in cyberspace.

### _Suspending_ uncertainties by using trust

A fourth strategy to deal with uncertainty is to accept that it exists, but to suspend it to be able to act under ambiguous conditions. This is exemplified by using trust as a response to uncertainty. In this case, one accepts that there is a fundamental uncertainty, that full control is principally unattainable and that it is unconstructive to seek such control. Instead, one embraces the idea that despite the fact that there is no full control, systems and people can be trusted, relied upon, to function in a predictable manner – at least to some extent and under certain conditions.

Complexity is reduced through trust; it enables us to act against a backdrop of high ambiguity and variability.

When we trust others or systems, we temporarily put complexities between brackets, and act _as if_ the outcome of whatever it is we are engaging in is predictable and stable.

Trust can act as a strategy with respect to uncertainty in cyberspace on several levels:

- Using cyberspace _requires_ trust in systems, in code, in data, in the organizations and governments that facilitate this ecosystem's functioning, and in the organizations and individuals that we connect with via cyberspace.
- Trust acts as a key _mechanism_ in relation to the adoption of processes, procedures and approaches to increase cyber-security. Risk management has come to function as the dominant strategy for cyber-security, but as of yet there is little scientific evidence of its effectiveness in this domain. The adoption of risk management for cyber-security may therefore be viewed as an act of trust.
- Trust is also used as an explicit cyber-security _strategy_: it is used to reduce uncertainty with respect to security in and of cyberspace

### _Ignoring_ uncertainties by choosing not to act on them

The previous four strategies all take an active stance towards uncertainty in cyberspace: they all aim to do something in the face of this uncertainty. A final strategy, however, of dealing with uncertainty in cyberspace, is to not only radically accept that it is a fundamental characteristic of this ecosystem, but also to do nothing in response to its manifestations.

Currently this strategy is not practiced very often in the field of cyber-security. Researchers and practitioners in the field sometimes express concern over the lack of response to encountered risks in cyberspace by business leaders or government representatives and plead for more active engagement with those risks. When ‘doing nothing’ equals ‘ignoring cyber-security risks’, this seems unwise.

In some cases, organizations do not act on cyber-security risks because they are overwhelmed or under-motivated, or they lack capabilities, capacities or funds. While this may be an unwise strategy, it is also understandable considering the rapid development of new technologies and their associated risks.

But there may also be other reasons to not act in relation to uncertainties in cyberspace and in some areas this could be considered a valid strategy. Doing nothing may entail a wait-and-see-approach. This strategy is particularly relevant in all instances where it is still unclear how significant or impact-full a particular vulnerability or risk is.

**Using a mixture of different strategies for different contexts and challenges would be best.**

### Different strategies for different problems. or not?

As this article has shown, in the current cyber-security landscape the dominant way of thinking about uncertainty in cyberspace is through the lens of risk management. In recent years, there is a noticeable shift towards resilience as a second strategy that complements the risk management paradigm. Risk management and resilience may be seen as complementary in the sense that the former focuses on the prevention of incidents, while the latter has a role to play once incidents have materialized.

Increasingly, researchers and practitioners also see potential for regulation as a strategy to deal with uncertainty in cyberspace. For a long time, regulation was considered a rather weak mechanism for cyberspace. Pointing to the global nature of cyberspace, and the power of private parties, who own and operate the vast majority of all architecture and services in cyberspace, the central assumption was that influencing actors’ behavior in cyberspace through regulation would not be an effective strategy. Over time, this view has changed, in part because discussions have tended to focus more concretely on, for instance, standard-setting and certification.

Using trust or doing nothing (in the sense of delaying a response) are currently not considered as common strategies on any significant scale. Both have their merits under certain conditions.

### Dealing with uncertainty in cyberspace: using all tools in toolbox

This article shows that there is a wide variety of uncertainties in cyberspace due to its complex makeup, and that there is also an assortment of possible responses to these uncertainties. As a matter of fact, oftentimes vulnerabilities, threats and risks are best addressed using a mixture of different strategies.

They complement and strengthen each other. Regulation works best in a reality in which shared norms already exist, while shared norms and regulation foster and are fed by trust. Similarly, resilience thrives when basic risks have been managed properly, while risk management is most conducive in environments that also focus on preparedness for eventual incidents.

Each of the individual responses to uncertainty that have been discussed in this article have their merits and weaknesses.

#### Risk management

works best for all so-called ‘subway uncertainties’: uncertainties that appear with relative regularity, so that they can be predicted using probabilistic mathematics. This kind of uncertainties follows a Bell curve pattern and materialize with such constancy that their occurrence can be quantified. When the impact of the materialization of this kind of risk is also fairly well-known, risk management can come to its maximum potential. A clear example of a type of uncertainty that can be addressed well using risk management is combatting DDoS attacks.

#### Resilience

Resilience can be used be to prepare for so-called ‘coconut uncertainties’.
To do justice to the complexity of cyberspace, and to the potential of cascading effects, butterfly effects, and the effects of tight coupling, incident planning and investment in recovery efforts is necessary. The current trend of [ransomware](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/malware "Learn more about ransomware from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is one of these areas where a resilience approach works best. 
Defense-in-depth and a Swiss Cheese model approach enable organizations to create defensive layers to face this challenge as well as they possibly can, while also allocating time, effort and means for crisis management should the defenses fail.

#### Regulation

Regulation has potential for two problem areas: addressing uncertainties caused by weak design and thwarting the deliberate exploitation of vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Weak design leads to vulnerabilities in code, configurations, processes and communications. Regulation can help remedy this issue by setting standards for technology design and [service delivery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/service-delivery "Learn more about service delivery from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and it can help foster trust through, e.g., certification, standardization and oversight.

Malicious actors of a wide variety may willfully exploit vulnerabilities in cyberspace and are, therefore, one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in this ecosystem. Regulation may have a deterrent effect on such abuse and may lead to prosecution and punishment in case of actual transgressions.

#### Trust

Trust can be used as a viable strategy to deal with uncertainties when implicit normative frameworksalready exist, in contexts in which interpersonal connections are essential, and in which harm is limited in cases of transgression. One area where this is fruitful is information sharing with respect to threats or zero days or vulnerabilities.

#### Doing nothing

Finally, doing nothing is suitable for uncertainties where data on likelihoods is lacking but there is sufficient evidence that no severe harm will be done in the case of incidents. When new threats emerge on the horizon, it oftentimes remains difficult for quite some time to get a sense of the likelihood with which they will materialize, and the conditions under which they will do so. Reliable data on incidents relating to this kind of threat are not easy to come by. If, on top of this, the impact of an incident would be limited, then it is safe to take a wait-and-see-response. An example of this kind of uncertainty in cyberspace is the discovery of vulnerabilities that do not lead to serious system risks and are labelled ‘low/low’ by (inter)national organizations that label emerging threats.

#### TLDR

Collectively, risk management, resilience, regulation, trust and doing nothing can be seen as different tools in a toolbox. For some challenges, a hammer works best, and for others a saw or a set of pliers. The same goes for responding to different uncertainties in cyberspace. Choosing the right tool for the right problem would strengthen cyber-security efforts across the board and decrease uncertainty in cyberspace to a considerable degree.
