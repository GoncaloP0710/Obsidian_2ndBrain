# Sensors and Detectors

What’s the difference between a sensor and a detector?
- None, both are sensors

Advanced threat detection usually requires many sensors being used together.

Each sensor has three main properties:
- Vantage: sensor location
- Domain: what it sees
- Action: what it does with the data

## Sensor Placement (Vantage)

A sensor’s vantage describes the data that a sensor will be able to observe.
No single sensor provides complete coverage of the network.
To cover the whole network, redundant traffic will be collected.
Determining vantage is a three-step process:
- Acquire a map of the network and define the list of potential instrumentation points
- Determine the vantage of each point, i.e., list the src-dst IP ranges that each point can see
- Pick the set of points that cover the whole network with minimal redundancy

## Sensor Domains

In the previous figure, sensor G is different from all others in that it does not monitor general network traffic, but only HTTP traffic: it collects data in a different domain.
There are three possible domains for a sensor:
- **Network**: traffic data seen by IDSes, VPNs, flow collectors (e.g., Yaf), TCP collectors (e.g., Snort), raw data collector (e.g., tcpdump), etc.
- **Host**: host activities such as login, logout, file accesses, use of USBs, system log files and security logs, etc.
- **Service**: logs generated by a particular service processes such as HTTP and SMTP servers (e.g., mail sent, HTTP requests served)

Sensors in different domains provide richer information than a single sensor.

## Sensor Actions

A sensor action describes how it interacts with the data it collects.

Three basic actions:
- **Report**: simply provide information about the phenomena it observes. E.g., netflow, tcpdump, and syslog.
- **Event**: consumes multiple data to produce an event and that summarize some subset of data. E.g., IDSes, and AntiVirus.
- **Control**: like an event sensor but modifies or block traffic. E.g., IPSes, firewalls, and antispam.

## Data Storage

Collected events can be stored in any storage system.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System

Security Operation Centres: monitor and manage the cybersecurity of organizations

SIEM Systems: distributed tools used to collect, analyse and report cybersecurity-related events.
