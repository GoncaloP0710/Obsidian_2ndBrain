# Vulnerable and Outdated Components

The application is built using several components which were developed externally.
- the adversary can find a vulnerability in one of the components and creates the corresponding exploit.

Main problem
- the developers/system administrators do not use the latest version of a component or patch the vulnerabilities

Protection
- remove unnecessary features and components
- monitor the security of all components and keep them up to date
