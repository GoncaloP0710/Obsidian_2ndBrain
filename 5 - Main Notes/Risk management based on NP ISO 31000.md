# Risk management based on NP ISO 31000

### Principles
- **Integrated** - Risk management should be an integral part of all organizational activities
- **Structured and Comprehensive** - Risk management should follow a structured and comprehensive approach
- **Customized** - The risk management framework should be tailored to the organization's internal and external context

### Framework
- **Mandate and Commitment** - Leadership's mandate and commitment are foundational to the success of the risk management framework
	- Leaders must allocate sufficient resources
	- Clear communication of the importance of risk management to all stakeholders is essential
- **Design of the Structure for Managing Risk** - This step involves creating a risk management framework that fits the organization’s specific needs and context
- **Implementation of Risk Management** - Once the framework is designed, it must be implemented across all levels of the organization
- **Monitoring and Review of the Structure** - Regular monitoring and review ensure the risk management framework remains effective and relevant
- **Continuous Improvement of the Structure** - Risk management is not a one-time process but a continuous cycle

### Process
- **Context Establishment** - This is the foundation of the risk management process, where the internal and external environments are defined
	- Understand the **objectives** of the organization or project
	- Define the **scope** and **criteria** for risk management
	- Identify external and internal factors that may influence risks
- **Risk Assessment** - The core of the process includes **three interconnected stages**:
	- **Risk Identification** - Identify potential risks that could impact objectives
	- **Risk Analysis** - Analyze the risks to understand their nature, likelihood, and potential impact
	- **Risk Evaluation** - Compare the results of the analysis against the defined risk criteria to decide which risks need treatment
- **Risk Treatment** - Once risks are evaluated, treatment options are selected and implemented to reduce or mitigate their impact
- **Risk Acceptance** - After treatment, risks are reviewed to determine if they are within acceptable limits
- **Risk Monitoring and Review** - The process doesn’t end with risk acceptance; continuous monitoring is essential to ensure ongoing effectiveness
