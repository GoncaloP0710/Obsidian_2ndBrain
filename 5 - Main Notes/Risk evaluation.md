# Risk evaluation

Once the risks have been identified and both likelihood and severity of consequence values assigned, and the level of risk assigned, one should apply the risk **acceptance criteria**, defined in the context establishment phase, to determine whether the risks can be accepted. If they canâ€™t be accepted, they should be prioritized for treatment.

Output: a list of prioritized risks with scenarios that lead for those risks, whether a risk treatment is required and suggestions for risk management.
