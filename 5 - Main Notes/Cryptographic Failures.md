# Cryptographic Failures

Failures related to **cryptography** (or lack of), which often lead to sensitive data exposure. We need to worry about data in **transit** and at **rest**!

Most common problems
- hard coding keys and storing keys in unprotected stores
- weak key generation or no key rotation

### Protection
- Discard unnecessary sensitive data as soon as possible
- Encrypt all sensitive data while stored or in transit
- Use strong cryto algorithms
