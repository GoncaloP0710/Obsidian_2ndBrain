# Other Analysis Tasks

## Application identification

Can be done using (in order of effectiveness):
- Traffic port numbers (only work for standard ports)
- Looking on portions of the payload (first packets)
- Behavioral analysis (only solution for encrypted traffic)

## Network mapping

Having an up-to-date inventory and network map is your only hope to avoid being flooded by false positives.

Building a network map is a continuous, interactive process of probing, technical analysis and interviews with site administrators.

This usually starts with a definition of the IP space and ends with the identification of clients and servers.
