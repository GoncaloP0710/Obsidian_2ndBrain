# Command Injection Attack

A **command injection attack** occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in an application to execute arbitrary operating system (OS) commands on the server. This happens when the application passes untrusted input directly to system-level commands without proper validation or sanitization.

Command injection attacks can lead to severe consequences, such as unauthorized access, data theft, system compromise, or even a complete takeover of the server.
