The direct costs of cybersecurity are those costs that can be clearly linked to specific breaches. E.g. Personnel, hardware...

The indirect costs of cybersecurity are those that cannot be clearly linked to a particular breach - at least not with any reasonable degree of accuracy. E.g. overall cost of an IDS that is used to identify numerous breaches. Although the overall cost of the system can be measured, there is no absolutely correct way to allocate the cost to specific breaches.

The implicit costs of cybersecurity are opportunity costs (i.e. costs associated with lost opportunities) which cannot be measured without ambiguity.
