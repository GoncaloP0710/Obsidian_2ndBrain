# Contingency Planning Process

## Contingency planning management team (CPMT)

Consists of an individual or team.
CPMT responsibilities:
- Obtain commitment and support
- Manage and conducting the overall CP process
- Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA)
- Organize and staff subordinate teams leadership
	- Incident response
	- Disaster recovery
	- Business continuity
	- Crisis management

Four required CP process elements
- Planning methodology
- Policy environment
- Understanding causes and effects of core precursor activities
- Access to financial and other resources

### Business impact analysis (BIA)
The business impact analysis (BIA) is the first phase of the CP process and serves as an investigation and assessment of the impact that various adverse events can have on the organization.

### Disaster Recovery
Disaster recovery planning (DRP) entails preparation for and recovery from a disaster, whether natural or man-made.
The DR team, led by the manager designated as the DR team leader, begins with the development of the DR policy soon after the team is formed.

A DR Plan can classify disasters in a number of ways:
- Natural disasters
- Man-made disasters
By speed of development:
- Rapid onset disasters
- Slow onset disasters

Scenario development and impact analysis are used to categorize the level of threat of each potential disaster. When generating a DR scenario, start with the most important asset: people.

Because the DR and BC plans are closely related, most organizations merge the two functions into a single function called business resumption planning (BRP).

### Business Continuity
Business Continuity Planning (BCP):
- Sometimes, disasters have such a profound effect on the organization that it cannot continue operations at its primary site until it fully completes all DR efforts, which requires business continuity (BC) strategies.
- BC planning (BCP) ensures critical business functions can continue in a disaster.

### Crisis Management
The critical difference between disasters and crises is in the personnel aspect of these events.

Crisis management team is responsible for:
- Supporting personnel and their loved ones during the crisis
- Keeping the public informed about the event and the actions being taken to ensure the recovery of personnel and the enterprise
- Communicating with major customers, suppliers, partners, regulatory agencies, industry organizations, the media, and other interested parties

The crisis management planning team (CMPT) should establish a base of operations or command center near the site of the disaster as soon as possible.
The CMPT should include individuals from all functional areas of the organization in order to facilitate communications and cooperation.

The CMPT is charged with three primary responsibilities:
- Verifying personnel status
- Activating the alert roster
- Coordinating with emergency services
