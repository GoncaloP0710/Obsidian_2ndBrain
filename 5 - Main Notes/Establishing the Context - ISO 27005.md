# Establishing the Context - ISO 27005

### Key Aspects of Establishing the Context
1. **Define the External Context** - Analyze external factors that influence information security risks
2. **Define the Internal Context** - Understand internal factors that affect the organization's ability to manage risks
3. **Define the Scope** - Identify the boundaries and focus areas for the risk management process
4. **Establish Risk Criteria** - Define how risks will be evaluated, prioritized, and treated

### Outputs of Context Establishment
- A **clear understanding** of the organization's environment, objectives, and challenges.
- A **defined scope** for the risk management process.
- A set of **criteria** for assessing and treating risks.

### Risk criteria
On the approach:
- Quantitative
- Qualitative
- Hybrid

On the scales
- May be different for different dimensions: likelihood, consequences, risk
- Tailored for the organization
- Understandable and comprehensive

### Likelihood criteria
Likelihood - is the overall rating (a numerical value on a defined scale) of the probability that a specific vulnerability will be exploited.

### Risk acceptance criteria
It may be necessary to set thresholds of acceptance for extreme consequences regardless of their likelihood or extremely high likelihoods regardless of consequences, where the effect on the organization primarily results from one or the other.

Rather than solely focusing on the **overall level of risk** (a combination of likelihood and consequence), the **likelihood**, **consequence**, and **costs of management** should be considered **independently** to make more informed and effective decisions.

The threshold of acceptance relates to the companyâ€™s risk appetite. One should look at over-control.
- Risk appetite refers to the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and operational objectives. In simple terms, it is the organization's tolerance for uncertain or hazardous situations, balancing potential benefits and disadvantages.

The risk criteria should be kept under review and updated as necessary.
