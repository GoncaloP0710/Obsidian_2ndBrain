# Intrusion management Methodologies

## Achieving trustworthiness w.r.t. malicious faults

### INTRUSION PREVENTION
- Attack prevention
	- Ensuring attacks do not take place against certain components
- Attack removal
	- Taking measures to discontinue attacks that took place
- Vulnerability prevention
	- Ensuring vulnerabilities do not appear in certain components
- Vulnerability removal
	- Eliminating vulnerabilities in certain components (e.g., bugs)

#### Avoiding security failure

## When and where to use intrusion tolerance?

**Intrusion tolerance** is a methodology for achieving trustworthiness systematically.
The objective is to **complement** classical techniques related with intrusion prevention.
A trusted-trustworthy component A which is **intrusion tolerant** tends to have its **properties satisfied** with a **higher coverage**
It means that other components and systems can **trust** A with **more confidence**.
Intrusion tolerance is a relatively **expensive** technique, typically reserved for critical systems.
