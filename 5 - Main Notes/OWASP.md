# OWASP Testing Framework

An end-to-end testing framework is crucial for assessing and improving software security, as failure to do so has a significant cost for the software company and its client organizations.

The framework is designed for a **generic software development model**, supporting a variety of methodologies.

### Before Development Begins
- Select an SDLC: where security is defined in every stage
- Have Policies and Standards: ensure that there are well documented policies
- Define Metrics: choose the criteria to be measured

### During Definition and Design
- Review of Security Requirements: these requirements define how an application works from a security perspective
- Review of the Design and Architecture: applications should have a documented design and architecture
- Threat Model Review: undertake a threat modeling exercise

### During Development
- Code Walk Through: developers and system architects should go through the code with the security team
- Code Reviews: checking the code

### During Deployment
- Application Penetration Testing
- Configuration Management Testing: checking how the infrastructure is deployed and configured

### Maintenance and Operations
- Conduct Periodic Health Checks
- Ensure Change Verification: every change has been approved and tested
